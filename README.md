# Midterm Project: Franklin's

Franklin's is a full stack web application built around Node and Express that allows a restaurant owner to accept orders online through a server. Franklin's includes the following functionality:

1. Customers can select items from a menu and checkout using the shopping cart.
2. Restaurant owners can add new menu items directly from the site itself.
3. Backend database records the actual cost and quantity of items for business analytics.
4. Customers and the Owner are notified of order status changes via text message.
5. Site design is responsive and will scale to a multitude of screen sizes.
6. Multiple order statuses (including functionality for the Owner to specify prep time) allows both the Customer and Owner to see the exact state of their order.
